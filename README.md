# Exam Timetable Generator

This is a small, client-side single-page web app that lets a student select subjects and generate a personalised exam timetable PDF. I built this specifically for SIN/JAC students so should not be used generally as the papers/exam boards/dates may be wrong.

Note - this was built almost entirely using GH Copilot Agent.
